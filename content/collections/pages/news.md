The consequences levied by the family is often worse than what the authorities would do.'

Riding a train from the airport into the city is an experience as you go from small homes and fields into an area where you can't see the tops of buildings. The Tokyo metro area has around the same amount of people as all of Canada was something I kept in mind as I experienced crowds in the train stations and in the areas of the city like the scramble crossing."
