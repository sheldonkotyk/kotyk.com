        text: "Welcome to the latest iteration of my ministry newsletter. Formerly housed at dsdispatch.com, I've brought it back within Kotyk.com so I didn't have to worry about maintaining a second site. As you may notice, I've also simplified things. I'm still automating some of the cool numbers but honestly, most people just asked for a simple newsletter so I'll be making it easier on myself to send that, and easier for you to receive it in the place you want the notification. Due to security and privacy concerns, I won't send you more than a link back to a private page."
