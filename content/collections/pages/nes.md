        text: "Nes was born in Canora, Saskatchewan to Steve and Nellie Kotyk (Skoretz). He went to school in Buchanan and helped on the family farm. He worked in banking but retail was his calling. His stores carried electronics, musical instruments, books, and health food in various locations including Winnipeg MB, Estevan SK, Squamish BC, Medicine Hat and Lethbridge AB. He loved his customers and would spend hours with them, talking about current events, his faith, and anything else people wanted to\_discuss."
