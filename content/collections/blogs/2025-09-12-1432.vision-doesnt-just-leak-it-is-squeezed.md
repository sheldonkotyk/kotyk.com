        text: 'One of the first leadership principles shared with me when I was given a leadership role was that “Vision leaks, so you have to keep communicating it.” Yes, that is true, and like some have said, you want to have it leaking because it is flowing out into others on the team from their peers.

        text: 'In that bucket though, are sponges. Those sponges are the individuals on the team. And the villain in the metaphor isn’t just that sponges full of vision will eventually dry out, it is that even if the bucket is full of vision, some of the sponges can’t retain any of it. Why? They are being squeezed.'

Yet, when they shared it again, it was like they were saying it for the first time.'

        text: "It was then that the sponge metaphor came to mind to me because they were relatively new leaders and knowing their team, it wasn’t because they weren’t sharing the vision enough, it was because their people were being squeezed. Some of their team was tired, some didn't like change, and others were struggling with health concerns. Each of these fingers were squeezing them to the point that their capacity to hear a new vision was almost non-existent. Even being unsure of their new leadership brings another finger to the grip because they aren't ready to trust."

Someone that had the capacity to soak up a vision to the point it was dripping on the rest of the team, all of a sudden, isn’t on board, or is confused as to where things are headed. Their vision had been squeezed by some bad news at home, an ailing parent, or even a teething baby keeping them from sleeping.'

        text: 'What about the brand new teammate, they seem to just soak it up. That’s true, they often do. At the risk of taking the analogy too far however, a sponge just dropped into a bucket of liquid, doesn’t just soak it up, it floats on top. Until the squeeze happens, they don’t truly retain much, and will need a continual pouring of vision to keep from drying up. '

Teams that have gone through the pressure of the squeeze of external forces and have had their trust banks filled, their ailments healed, and their fears of change replaced with hope. As the grip is slowly released, a sponge liquid will have every air pocket filled. Just as a team member healing surrounded by vision will soak it up and start to drip the extra vision on others.'
