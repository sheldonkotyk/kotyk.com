    | couple of seconds has already cost the caller more than the signal is
    | worth, and the prober answers immediately after one state write.
    |
    | `log_failures` writes a debug line when a send fails. Useful while wiring
    | a site up; noise once it works, and never above debug level, because a

    |
    | Two ways to declare one, and a job may use either:
    |
    | `jobs` maps a job class to its heartbeat token. The package listens for
    | JobProcessed and JobFailed and pings on the way out, so the job's own code
    | is untouched. Best for jobs you do not own, or where success simply means
    | "handle() returned".
    |
    | Or add the SendsHeartbeat trait to the job and call its methods inside
    | handle(). Best when the job knows something the queue does not — that it
    | processed zero records, or reconciled a total that did not balance.
    |
    | Tokens are issued per heartbeat by the hub and appear in its manifest.
    | Keep them in the environment, not here: a token is a credential.
